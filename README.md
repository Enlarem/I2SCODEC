# I2S Codec for Embedded systems course

During the course entitled "Embedded systems design" at LUT university, me and Kříž Antonín teamed up to realize the final project.

We worked on the implementation of an I2S Layer capable of getting data from an SSM2603 CODEC and transmitting it back filtered (or not depending on the mode). This project aimed to be compiled and implemented on a Zybo 10 board. While we have implemented features with testbenches and documentation, we couldn’t figure out how to compile it on the Zybo 10 board, unfortunately. More details are given in the document "documentation/Documentation.pdf".

The project has been developped using the Vivado suite tool.
